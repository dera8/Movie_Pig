# MoviePig

Processing of data relating to a set of movies  through **Apache Pig**.

The analysis was performed with two execution mechanisms:

- **Interactive Mode (Grunt shell)**: inserting scripts into the shell and obtaining the output using the "dump" command.

- **Batch Mode (Script)**: writing Pig Latin scripts to a single file with .pig extension.
